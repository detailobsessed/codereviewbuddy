# Agent Instructions

This project uses **tk** (ticket) for issue tracking. Tickets are markdown files in `.tickets/`.

## Quick Reference

```bash
tk list               # List all open tickets
tk ready              # List tickets with deps resolved
tk show <id>          # View ticket details
tk start <id>         # Claim work (set to in_progress)
tk close <id>         # Complete work
tk create "title"     # Create a new ticket
```
